Embark on a journey with me as I navigate the realm of cybersecurity, breaking into electronic devices with the finesse of a Ghost Shell.

I thrive on solving complex puzzles, crafting Capture The Flag challenges, and hunting bugs on platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd.

Join me on this adventure to the Abyss. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-azoukni-6840a61a9/) to learn more about my work.
